I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Delft University of Technology with particular interest in flow instabilities and laminar-to-turbulent transition. My major focus lies on highly compressible and non-ideal fluid flows, in which unconventional high-temperature and gas dynamic effects are extremely relevant. My work combines high-fidelity simulations (direct numerical simulations) with stability analysis methods (modal and non-modal stability analysis).

My PhD research in the group of [Rene Pecnik](https://dutw1479.wbmt.tudelft.nl/~renep/) focused on the stability and transition to turbulence of fluids at supercritical pressure, which feature strong variations of properties (viscosity, density, etc.). 

My postdoctoral research in the group of [Marios Kotsonis](https://www.tudelft.nl/staff/m.kotsonis/) focuses on flow control through metamaterials, with the aim of postponing transition, thereby reducing turbulence and mitigating its impact on aerodynamic drag and noise.
